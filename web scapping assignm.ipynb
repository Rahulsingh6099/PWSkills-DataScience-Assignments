    "Web Scraping: Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching and parsing the HTML content of web pages to extract useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction: Web scraping is used to extract specific data from websites, including text, images, prices, and more.\n",
    "Automation: It automates the process of gathering information, saving time compared to manual data collection.\n",
    "Competitor Analysis: Businesses use web scraping to monitor competitors' prices, product listings, and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Different Methods Used for Web Scraping\n",
    "There are various methods for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: Manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a spreadsheet.\n",
    "Regular Expressions: Using regular expressions to extract specific patterns from HTML content.\n",
