    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: APIs allow for modular programming, enabling the development of independent components.\n",
    "Interoperability: APIs facilitate communication and data exchange between different software systems.\n",
    "Reuse: APIs promote code reuse by allowing developers to leverage existing functionality.\n",
    "Security: APIs can provide controlled access to specific features, enhancing security.\n",
    "Scalability: APIs support scalable development, allowing different teams to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: API integration can be complex, especially when dealing with multiple APIs.\n",
    "Dependency: Applications relying on external APIs are dependent on the API provider's availability and updates.\n",
    "Documentation: Poorly documented APIs can lead to challenges in understanding and using them.\n",

    "Complexity: SOAP messages are verbose and complex compared to REST, making them harder to read and debug.\n",
